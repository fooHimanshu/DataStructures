# Data Structures

Data Structure is a way of storing and organising data to make data operations more effective and efficient. There is exist a range of Data Structures and in this repo only the followings are implemented:

| S.No. | Data Structure                                               | Implementation     | in-code documentation | Markdown Documentation | Testing Status     |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| 1     | [Singly Linked List](./src/com/ds/linkedlist/LinkedList.md)  | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark:    | `TODO`                   | :white_check_mark: |
| 2     | [Queue Using Linked List](./src/com/ds/linkedlist/LQueue.md) | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark:    | `TODO`                  | `TODO`               |
| 3     | [Stack](./src/com/ds/linkedlist/Stack.md)                    | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark:    | `TODO`                  | `TODO`             |
| 4     | [Graphs](./src/com/ds/linkedlist/Graphs.md)                  | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark:    | `TODO`                  | :white_check_mark: |

:warning: If Markdown Documentation status is `TODO` on the table above, the hyperlinks won't work however, the code would still be there in the /src/com/ds/ directory to review. Thanks!

## Rules Followed

1. Before implementing the Data Structure, implement the requirements which, could be in form of implementing a required DS, implementation specification like Interfaces or any error handling mechanism. This is to reduce the Java native DS.

2. Every DS should have their own respective self explanatory documentation clearly mentioning the Space and Time complexity of the underlying DS.

## Who this repository is for?
